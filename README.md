# SELF-BALANCING-BICYCLE-USING-REACTING-WHEEL-WITH-IMPROVING-STABILITY
In this ever-growing scenario of the world with growing population and also vehicles, the problem persists more importantly for handicapped people to drive their vehicle on these overcrowded roads and ever-increasing traffic. This work uses a control moment gyroscope as an actuator. The control moment gyroscope is typically used in a spacecraft to orient the vessel. Appling as an actuator to balance a bicycle is a creative and novel approach and is the first of its kind for balancing of a bicycle. In this project a Self-balancing bicycle using reacting wheel were constructed with the intent of it balancing on of one of its edges using a PID-controller to counteract the gravity pulling it down. To be able to this a good understanding of the size team was required to have the right components for the job. A DC motor is used reaction wheel on each side of its axle using the moment of inertia to convert the torque from the motor to an angular acceleration of the bicycle. An IMU is used to determine the angle difference of the center of mass from a fixed point in the room and this value was used as an input in the PID-controller. Different method is used to determine the P, I and D components of the PID-controller to create a stable system. The main goal of this project is to build such a prototype that can balance itself on two wheels with the help of gyroscope. This self-balancing bike with the application of gyroscope will omit the need of extra set of wheels or support required by the handicapped people. Also, normal people can use this application to minimize the risk of road accidents due to the loss of balance when braking or stopping suddenly in traffic. This application will also benefit in stabilizing the bike without any need of human help externally. As this bike will be fully powered by rechargeable cells, even though different methods are used no one successfully made the bicycle perfectly.
